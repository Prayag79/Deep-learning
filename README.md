# Deep-learning
In this repo , i will be covering few concepts mention below learning and implementing them from scratch  !
The topics are :
1.Tensor flow
2.Keras
3.Pytorch
4.Autoencoders
5.diffusers
6.Transformers 

and few other concepts!

The notebooks usually starts with a number ( 00 , 01 ... ) and the topic learned .

00_pytorch contains basics of tensors and working with tensors in pytorch
01_pytorch contains implementation of a model and a foundational workflow
